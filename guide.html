            If you know someone who might be thinking about suicide, you can
            help them first by listening. Very often, people who think suicide
            is a choice for them feel like they have no other options. Listening
            to someone can show that you care, give them a greater feeling of
            control, and help them feel connected to someone else. One way to
            invite conversation is by using open-ended questions, such as “What
            brought these feelings on?”or “What do you do when you feel like
            this?” Make sure to show that you're an active, attentive, and
            empathetic listener by validating their feelings. Let them know that
            it takes a lot of courage to talk about this topic, that you're here
            to listen, and that they shouldn't have to go through this alone.

            Asking about suicide can be scary, but it is very important to find
            out how much danger someone may be in. It also lets them know that
            you're a safe person to talk to. Many people are afraid to talk
            about their suicidal thoughts. They fear that others will react with
            blame, fear, panic, or guilt. Research shows that asking about
            suicide will not suggest the idea to someone. After you have
            listened for a while, ask directly: “I'm concerned about you. Are
            you thinking about killing yourself?” If the answer is yes, keep
            listening and show the person you care. Ask follow-up questions
            about their plan: Have you thought about how you might do it? Do you
            already have the means (guns, pills, etc.) available? Have you
            decided when you will do this? Do you know where? If the answer is
            no, keep listening. Don't tell the person you're glad or relieved
            that they're not thinking about it. Their feelings may change, and
            then they may feel uncomfortable talking to you about it again. If
            the answer to all these questions is yes, the person is at high risk
            for suicide and we encourage you to get further help.

            A suicidal person needs a lot of support - more than any one person
            can give. Getting help for someone who is feeling suicidal can save
            their life. Even if the person does not have a plan, get help from a
            counselor, teacher, medical professional, crisis center, or
            emergency room. You should talk to any of these helpers yourself to
            get support and advice, but it is most important that the suicidal
            person talks directly with one or more of these kind of helpers. If
            the suicidal person won't agree to get help, tell someone anyway. It
            is better to have them be mad at you, but alive because you got
            help. If the person you're concerned about has already set a time
            and/or place for a suicide attempt, or if you think for any reason
            that she or he wants to attempt suicide soon, keep these tips in
            mind: Stay calm. This can feel scary or out of control, but the
            person you're helping feels more out of control than you do and
            needs you to be calm. Don't leave the suicidal person. If you're not
            with them, go get them or find someone who can stay with them. Most
            people won't attempt suicide unless they're alone. Call 911 or
            another professional who can help immediately. Remember: don't leave
            the person to make this call.
